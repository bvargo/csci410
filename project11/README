main.py is the driver program. It is invoked as follows:
./main.py source

Given the above invocation, the .jack files in source will be compiled into .vm
vm files. If a directory is passed, then all .jack files in the directory
will be converted.

Please note that I have decided to skip the intermediate symbol table XML
support and instead proceed with simple testing. Thus, my project 10 directory
does not contain the symbol table code.
