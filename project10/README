main.py is the driver program. It is invoked as follows:
./main.py source

Given the above invocation, the .jack files in source will be tokenized into
xml files. Eventually, the .jack files will also be parsed. Tokenizing outputs
MainT.xml, while parsing outputs Main.xml (for a Main.jack input).

If a directory is passed, then all .jack files in the directory will be
converted.

The original XML files, for comparison purposes, are located in the original_xml
directory under each program directory.
