main.py is the driver program. It is invoked as follows:
./main.py program.vm
Given the above invocation, the file program.asm will be created in the same
directory as program.vm.

If a directory is passed instead of a single vm file, then the resulting .asm
file will have the same name as the directory and will be placed at the same
level in the filesystem.  That is, the output .asm file is NOT placed within
the directory itself. For example, suppose ./foo/bar/ contains baz1.vm and
baz2.vm. Then, ./main.py ./foo/bar will produce ./foo/bar.asm, not
./foo/bar/bar.asm. This is my interpretation of reading the program
requirements. The chapter says the following: "The result of the translation
is always a single assembly language file named Xxx.asm, created in the same
directory as the input Xxx." Since the input is ./foo/bar, then bar.asm must
be output at the same level as the original directory.
